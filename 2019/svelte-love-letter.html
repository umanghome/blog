    <p>An appreciation post for <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>.</p>

    <p>I started writing HTML about fourteen years ago. Just plain, old HTML. Then about six years ago, I learned CSS and found the web to be a really, really cool platform to build things upon. I learned JavaScript and PHP and all that jazz and built <a href="https://pictureband.co">Picture Band</a>. Picture Band's frontend had a lot JavaScript, and all of it was jQuery.</p>
<p>Then I met with someone who wanted to discuss about Picture Band, and they recommended I port Picture Band to a mobile app using Cordova and React. &quot;React&quot;? I'd read that word a lot on the Internet but I was so intimidated from the hype around it that I never really felt comfortable learning it.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friendly reminder that the quickest way to learn something is to just get started.<br><br>Three and a half years ago, I was so intimidated by the hype around Node.js and React.js that it prevented me from exploring them.</p>&mdash; Umang Galaiya (@umanghome) <a href="https://twitter.com/umanghome/status/966211981064769538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>But I eventually did. And I fell in love. It was just <em>so</em> damn easy to build things with React. And fun too. It was a total game-changer at the time. It wouldn't be a stretch if someone thought I got into writing frontend apps just because of React. Over the next couple of years, I had built a lot of shit with React. And it was fun.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I will forever be grateful to <a href="https://twitter.com/facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@facebook</a> for giving the world React and React Native.</p>&mdash; Umang Galaiya (@umanghome) <a href="https://twitter.com/umanghome/status/658658179660668928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>About a year ago, our team at <a href="https://razorpay.com">Razorpay</a> decided we were going to write all new apps in <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>. Svelte is built by Rich Harris, who has also written <a href="https://rollupjs.org">rollup.js</a> (our bundler of choice at Razorpay). I didn't have any strong feelings about the decision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Svelte is a framework for building frontend apps. It compiles everything down to native DOM calls at build-time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Svelte was at <a href="https://v2.svelte.dev">v2</a> when we started using it. It felt a lot like React. <code>setState</code> became <code>set</code>, and a lot of APIs looked kinda similar with some changes sprinkled here and there.</p>
<p>I kinda started liking Svelte more and more as we kept using it. OVer a couple of weeks, I had completely stopped writing React and would prefer writing Vanilla or Svelte. But it wasn't <em>love</em> yet. But I was impressed with Svelte. So much that I'd decided I was going to talk about it at <a href="https://hasgeek.com/jsfoo/2019/">JSFoo 2019</a>. I started preparing a proposal built on Svelte v2. I knew v3 was in the works and had read a couple RFCs, but I didn't think it would be released exactly a day after I had finished preparing my proposal based on Svelte v2. Had to scrap the proposal, go through v3 docs and tutorial, and rebuild everything from scratch. Wasn't bad.</p>
<p>v3 looked really cool with reactivity being it's core idea. We thought about upgrading one of our apps to v3. There's this really cool thing called <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-upgrade">svelte-upgrade</a> that converts v2 templates to v3 and saves a lot of effort. We decided not to go ahead with the upgrade and stuck to v2. All good.</p>
<p>Then, this weekend, Razorpay had an internal Hackathon where my team and I decided to build something that would let your phone and computer talk to each other for Payments. This needed a UI, both on the phone and on the computer. I don't really know how to build UIs in Android and decided to use a WebView instead. We forked the Svelte v3 <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/template">template</a> and got around to building the UI. This was the first time I was building something full-fledged with Svelte v3. Everything else I'd written with v3 were just things I was trying out in the framework.</p>
<p>By the end of the Hackathon, we had built a UI that looked production-grade. Transitions and all that jazz. And never once during the time did I feel I had to wrestle with Svelte. Things fell right into place, and so beautifully at that! This is when I fell in love with Svelte. It's the same exact feeling I had when I had fallen in love with React after using jQuery for years.</p>
<p>v3 has some quirks, especially if you're coming from v2, but they're okay and never felt like deal-breakers. It's a relatively new framework and I'm sure it's going to be a lot better once it matures. But even at this point in time, when v3 is less than six months old, writing Svelte feels like a breeze.</p>
<p>I would never consider myself a transitions guy. I suck at writing animations. I make do with <code>transform</code>s and <code>transition</code>s. But Svelte's baked-in support for transitions enabled me to create something that looks like this, and performs without a glitch.</p>

<p>Things in Svelte are reactive by default. No more invoking <code>setState</code> or <code>set</code> every time you need to change something. Reassign the variable and watch things <em>react</em>.</p>
<p>I love computed props and how you never have to worry about updating props that depend on other props. Everything takes care of itself.</p>
<p>I love scoped CSS.</p>
<p>I love how writing Svelte templates feels just like writing plain, old HTML.</p>
<p>I'd gone through the <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a> docs a couple of days ago, and even that felt well-thought, easy to get started with. Much easier than fighting with react-router and watching the API change every six months.</p>
<p>If you've never given Svelte a try, now is the time. It won't solve all your problems, maybe your app would be better off written in React/Vue/Angular/whatever. But Svelte really shines at times and is <em>extremely</em> pleasant to write. It's like writing Python after years of C++.</p>
<p>I'll be <a href="https://hasgeek.com/jsfoo/2019/schedule/rethinking-frontend-apps-with-svelte-wgXuufqr6bvB2Zt8gDnCRj">talking about Svelte at JSFoo this year</a>. If you're around and would like to hear me fanboy-ing over Svelte, drop by!</p>
