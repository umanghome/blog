# Umang's blog

---

This is currently built on top of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids).

Original blog was built in Jekyll. I don't know a lot of ruby to be able to extend the blog. And I spent four hours trying to read illegible ruby errors until I figured out I had to downgrade my ruby version to a specific version to get things to work. Since I'm more familiar with Node than I am with Ruby, it only makes sense for me to use something built on top of Node. Bye Jekyll.

Uses [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) for templating and and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for CSS.

Jekyll version is stored in the `jekyll` branch.
